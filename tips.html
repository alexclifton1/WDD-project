        <h1>Tips to recycle properly</h1>
		<br>
        <p>1: Use the correct bins when throwing away your rubbish. For example, when throwing away glass bottles of alcohol, put the bottles into a bottle bank where the different companies can break down the glass and can recycle them.
		<br>
		   2: Dont litter, it makes it harder to recycle when you leave a wrapper of a pack of sweeties or an empty bottle of coke on the floor. This can affect the wildlife in Ireland because it can end up in the stomachs of the country's seagulls and many other birds.
		<br>
		   3: Make sure to recycle food waste as it can save you money, reverse climate change, conserve energy and resources and it will produce energy and fertilizer.
