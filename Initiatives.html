		<h1>Initiatives</h1>
		<br>
        <p>Our initiatives is to make all single-use containers to be recycled properly so they protect the environment from damaging the o-zone layer. We would do this by providing recycling bins to as many colleges around Dublin City as possible to encourage students to start recycling regularly and build it into their routine. By doing this, hopefully for the future generation, recycling will be viewed as a very important factor in their lives </p>
		<br>
		<p>We would also like to integrate reusable drinking bottles that would be given out in colleges to students free of charge. This would reduce the amount of plastics that are thrown away having a positive impact on the environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Our plans for the near future is to have distributed recycling bins around the whole of Dublin City colleges and to drastically the amount of plastic that is going to waste</p>
